## Context

As we transition to a microservice architecture, we need a consistent authentication strategy across services. Our requirements include:

- Secure service-to-service communication
- Support for user authentication with different permission levels
- Minimal performance overhead
- Compatibility with our existing identity management system
- Auditability of access patterns

## Decision

We will implement a token-based authentication strategy with the following components:

1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication:

   - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
   - Signed with RS256 (asymmetric) algorithm

2. **Service Authentication**:

   - Service-specific API keys for initial authentication
   - Service-to-service communication secured with mutual TLS
   - Service identity managed through Vault

3. **User Authentication Flow**:

   - Central authentication service issues tokens
   - Claims include user ID, roles, permissions, and token metadata
   - Tokens validated at API gateway and individual services

4. **Token Validation**:
   - Public key distribution for token verification
   - Token blacklisting for revocation
   - Rate limiting on token issuance and refresh endpoints

## Consequences

### Positive

- Decentralized validation reduces bottlenecks
- Stateless authentication simplifies scaling
- Fine-grained permission control
- Consistent authentication pattern across services
- Reduced latency compared to centralized session validation

### Negative

- Need to manage key rotation and distribution
- Slightly increased payload size for requests
- Token revocation requires additional infrastructure
- Learning curve for developers new to JWT

## Implementation

- Use Auth0 as our identity provider
- Implement token validation middleware for each service
- Set up key rotation schedule (quarterly)
- Create developer documentation with authentication examples
- Add monitoring for failed authentication attempts
